Ah, good question! That comes from **Reactâ€™s `setState` updater function**. Let me explain carefully.

---

When you call a `useState` setter like `setInvoiceCreate`, you can use **two forms**:

1. **Direct value**:

```ts
setInvoiceCreate(newInvoice); 
```

* You just pass the new state directly.
* Problem: If you rely on the current state inside the update, you might accidentally use stale data (because React batches state updates).

---

2. **Updater function**:

```ts
setInvoiceCreate(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  ...update,
}));
```

* Here, instead of passing a value, you pass a **function**.
* React calls this function with the **current state** as `prev`.
* `prev` is just a parameter name; you could call it `current` or anything.

```ts
setInvoiceCreate(currentInvoice => ({
  ...currentInvoice,
  ...update,
}));
```

* `...prev` copies all existing fields.
* `...update` overrides only the fields you provide.
* This guarantees youâ€™re working with the latest state, even if multiple updates happen at the same time.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Summary:**

* `prev` = current state value of `invoiceCreate`.
* It comes from React internally when you pass a function to `setInvoiceCreate`.
* Using the updater function is safer than reading `invoiceCreate` directly in some cases.

---

If you want, I can rewrite your **entire `handleCreateInvoiceChange` function** with `null` handling **and** `Partial<InvoiceCreate>` in one clean type-safe version. It would replace all those repetitive `if` statements.

Do you want me to do that?
